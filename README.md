# PRODIGY_DS_01

## Aim
To create visualizations that show the distribution of gender (categorical variable) and age (continuous variable) using the Titanic dataset.

## Procedure
### Import Libraries:
1.Import pandas for data handling. Import seaborn for creating the plots. Import matplotlib.pyplot for displaying the plots. Load the Titanic Dataset:

2.Use seaborn's built-in function to load the Titanic dataset.

### Create a Bar Chart for Gender Distribution:
Use seaborn to create a bar chart that shows how many male and female passengers are in the dataset. Label the chart with a title and axis labels for clarity. Display the bar chart.

### Create a Histogram for Age Distribution:
Use seaborn to create a histogram that shows how the passengers' ages are spread out. Add a title and labels to make the histogram easy to understand. Display the histogram.

## Output:
Bar Chart: A visual representation showing the count of male and female passengers on the Titanic. Histogram: A visual representation showing how the ages of the passengers are distributed, including a smooth curve to highlight the pattern.
